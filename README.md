# FritzGate
## Introduction

Welcome to the project **FritzGate** that transforms your **Ai Thinker board** into a smart thermostat controller. This project enables seamless control of thermostats connected to a **FRITZ!Box**, integrating any of 70+ temperature sensors models for precise temperature control.

## Features

- **FRITZ!Box integration:** Connect and control thermostats directly from Fritzbox. FritzGate does not affect weekly plans or other thermostat settings.
- **Binding with external Temperature Sensors:** Utilize third party temperature sensors placed in living spaces for precise temperature control in a room. FritzGate automatically corrects temperature offsets of thermostat sensors.
- **Embedded Web Server:** Easily manage thermostat-sensor bindings, monitor temperature and humidity through a user-friendly web interface.

## Advantages

- **Easy Configuration:** Set up effortlessly by scanning a QR code with the Ai Thinker camera for Wi-Fi credentials.
- **Cost-Effective Hardware:** Utilize the budget-friendly and energy efficient ESP32-CAM board.
- **Can be Powered by FRITZ!Box:** Leverage the convenience of powering the device directly from the FRITZ!Box USB port, eliminating the need for additional space and power sources.
- **Optimized for Climate Control with third party Sensors:** Use any of [70+ models](https://decoder.theengs.io/devices/devices.html) of temperature sensors for precise climate control in living spaces, ensuring optimal comfort and energy savings.
- **Embedded Web Server:** Easily manage thermostat-sensor bindings through the embedded web server, providing an intuitive interface for users to customize and monitor their smart heating system.
- **Can be used without FRITZ!Box:** If you're not authorized in FritzBox, you can still monitor temperature and humidity from nearby temperature sensors.

This project caters to users looking for a straightforward, cost-effective, and energy-efficient solution for smart thermostat control. With the added flexibility of integrating third party temperature sensors, users can achieve optimal climate control in their living spaces. The easy configuration process and minimal hardware requirements make **FritzGate** an ideal choice for DIY enthusiasts seeking a hassle-free smart home solution.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- Ai Thinker ESP32-CAM board
- [Temperature sensors](https://decoder.theengs.io/devices/devices.html)
- Fritzbox with compatible thermostats (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vnau/FritzGate.git
    ```

2. Open the project in [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), depending on your preference.

3. **For PlatformIO Users:**
   - Upload the code to your Ai Thinker ESP32-CAM board.
   - After the first start, use the Ai Thinker ESP32-CAM board camera to scan the Wi-Fi QR code. This will configure the Wi-Fi credentials automatically.

4. **For Arduino IDE Users:**
   - Ensure you have  [NTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient) and [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) Arduino libraries installed before building the project.
   - Set Wi-Fi credentials directly in the code (alternatively, you can install the [ESP32QRCodeReader](https://github.com/alvarowolfx/ESP32QRCodeReader) library from Github to be able to read the WiFi QR code).
   - Upload the code to your Ai Thinker ESP32-CAM board.

5. Access the web interface by navigating to the assigned IP address in your web browser.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements. You can add additional features, integrate more IoT devices, or enhance automation rules.
